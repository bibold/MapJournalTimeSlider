Year, Info
1963,The Clean Air Act is passed in an effort to lower air pollution. 
1967,The Chesapeake Bay Foundation is formed.
1972,The Clean Water Act is passed, establishing water quality standards and limiting the amount and kind of pollutants that can enter rivers, streams and other waterways. An increase in polluted runoff and damage from Hurricane Agnes destroy underwater grass beds in the Chesapeake Bay.
1973,U.S. Senator Charles Mathias tours the Chesapeake Bay shoreline and sponsors legislation that prompts the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to conduct a study on the Bay’s health. This marks the first time that the Bay’s degrading health is brought to the public’s attention.
1980,The Chesapeake Bay Commission was established to assist the states in cooperatively managing the Chesapeake Bay.
1983,The first Chesapeake Bay Agreement is signed by governors of Maryland, Virginia and Pennsylvania, the mayor of the District of Columbia, the administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the chair of the  Chesapeake Bay Commission.
1984,Chesapeake Bay Commission was at the center of a coordinated effort to ban the use of phosphate detergents in all three Bay Program states.
1985,A Maryland ban on phosphate-containing laundry detergent reduces the amount of phosphorous flowing from wastewater treatment plants into the Chesapeake Bay.
1988,Virginia passes the Chesapeake Bay Preservation Act, guiding local governments to address the environmental impacts of development and pushing communities to better manage urban and suburban growth.
1989,Maryland and Virginia lift the ban on striped bass fishing. The fish is declared a recovered species six years later.
1990,Acid Rain Program (ARP), established under Title IV of the 1990 Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments, requires major emission reductions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), the primary precursors of acid rain, from the power sector. The SO2 program sets a permanent cap on the total amount of SO2 that may be emitted by electric generating units (EGUs) in the contiguous United States.
1992,Amendments are made to the 1987 Chesapeake Bay Agreement that aim to attack nutrients at their source: upstream tributaries that flow into the Chesapeake Bay.
1992,The Clean Vessel Act establishes a grant program to fund the construction of pumpout stations at marinas across the watershed, presenting a viable alternative to the overboard disposal of sewage.
1993,A law passed in Pennsylvania requires certain farmers to develop and implement nutrient management plans, limiting the amount of nitrogen and phosphorous that can run off of farms and into local waterways.
1994,A law passed in Virginia requires certain farmers to develop and implement nutrient management plans, limiting the amount of nitrogen and phosphorous that can run off of farms and into local waterways.
1995,Acid Rain Program (ARP) begins.
1996,Blue Plains Wastewater Treatment Plant begins to use nutrient removal technology to lower the amount of nitrogen it sends into the Potomac River and improve water quality.
1997,The Virginia Water Quality Improvement Act establishes a state fund that will support the prevention, reduction and control of nutrient pollution.
1998,The Maryland Water Quality Improvement Act calls for the addition of a phosphorous-reducing enzyme to poultry feed, lowering nutrient levels in poultry litter. 
1999,The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation establishes the Chesapeake Bay Stewardship Fund to help communities restore polluted rivers and streams.
2000,Chesapeake 2000 is signed, establishing more than 100 goals to reduce pollution and restore habitats, protect living resources and promote sound land use, and engage the public in restoration.
2002,More than 2,800 miles of forest buffers have been restored in the watershed, meeting the Bay Program’s goal for forest buffer restoration eight years ahead of schedule.
2003,First of five years that the NOx Budget Trading Program (NBP) dramatically reduced NOx emissions from power plants and industrial sources during the summer months, contributing significantly to improvements in ozone air quality in the eastern United States.
2005,Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) is finalized.  The Chesapeake Executive Council adopts an animal manure management strategy to reduce nutrient pollution from livestock operations.
2006,State Implementation Plans Submitted to EPA. The Chesapeake Executive Council adopts new directives to expand forest cover, reduce the amount of phosphorous in lawn fertilizers and increase funding for on-farm conservation programs.
2007,The NOx Budget Trading Program (NBP) begins for 21st and final state.  The Chesapeake Bay Interpretive Buoy System (CBIBS) is launched to report real-time environmental data on weather, water conditions, and water quality.
2008,The NOx Budget Trading Program (NBP) ends. Clean Air Interstate (CAIR) NOx programs training year.
2009,Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) CO2 program training year. Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) NOx ozone season. Phase I Cap in Place for Nox. Annapolis becomes the first jurisdiction in the watershed to ban phosphorous in lawn fertilizer.
2010,Clean Air Intersate Rule (CAIR) CO2 program begins. Phase I Cap in Place for SO2. Full implementation of the Acid Rain Program (ARP).
2011,Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR), requires states to significantly improve air quality by reducing power plant emissions that contribute to ozone and/or fine particle pollution in other states is finalized in January. In December, it is stayed pending judicial review.
2012,In January, the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) scheduled to begin replacing Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR). I August the court issues decision to vacate Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) and the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) remains in place. In October, the US Government files a petition for rehearsing en banc of the August 2012 court decision.
2013,A federal judge rules that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency can set pollution limits for the Chesapeake Bay, thus upholding the Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) that was challenged in court in 2011.
2014,The D.C. Circuit granted EPA's request that the court lift the CSAPR stay and toll the CSAPR compliance deadlines by three years. 
2015,Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) Phase 1 implementation is scheduled-Phase II Cap in Place for NOx and SO2.
2017,Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) Phase 2 implementation is scheduled.
